### **Example Conversation**
```
💬 You: Can you analyze my Python project performance?

🤖 Bob: [Automatically uses find_project, git_status, filesystem tools]
       I found your project at /path/to/project. It's a web-app with 15 commits 
       this week. Performance looks good with efficient code patterns. Here are 
       3 optimization suggestions...

💬 You: Remember that I prefer TypeScript for new projects

🤖 Bob: [Uses store_memory tool seamlessly]  
       I've stored your TypeScript preference in my memory system. I'll remember 
       this for future project recommendations and discussions.
