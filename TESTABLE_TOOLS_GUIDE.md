# Bob's Fixed Tools - Ready for Testing

## ✅ **Memory Tools - NOW WORKING**
```
💬: "Remember that I like Python programming"
→ Should execute: brain_remember tool
→ Expected: Tool execution with storage confirmation

💬: "What do you remember about me?" 
→ Should execute: brain_recall tool  
→ Expected: Tool execution with memory retrieval
```

## 🧪 **Other Tools Ready to Test**

### 🔋 **System Status**
```
💬: "What's my system status?"
→ Tool: brain_status
→ Should show: Bob's brain system health information
```

### 🕵️ **Bullshit Detection** 
```
💬: "Analyze this text for BS: This revolutionary AI will solve all world problems instantly using quantum blockchain synergy"
→ Tool: detect_bullshit
→ Should show: Analysis with bullshit score
```

### 📁 **File Operations**
```
💬: "Can you read this file: /Users/bard/Bob/README.md"
→ Tool: filesystem_read
→ Should show: File contents

💬: "List the contents of /Users/bard/Bob"
→ Tool: filesystem_list  
→ Should show: Directory listing
```

### 🔧 **Development Tools**
```
💬: "What's the git status of this project?"
→ Tool: git_status
→ Should show: Git repository status

💬: "Find the Bob project"
→ Tool: find_project
→ Should show: Project discovery results
```

### 🧠 **Cognitive Processing**
```
💬: "Process this cognitively: I need to understand the relationship between AI ethics and consciousness"
→ Tool: cognitive_process
→ Should show: AI reasoning and insights
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Test Order**

**1. Memory Tools (Just Fixed!):**
- `"Remember that I like Python programming"`
- `"What do you remember about me?"`

**2. Simple System Check:**
- `"What's my system status?"`

**3. Fun Analysis:**
- `"Analyze this for BS: [some marketing text]"`

**4. File Operations:**
- `"List the contents of /Users/bard/Bob"`

## 🚨 **Expected Success Pattern**

For any working tool, you should see:
```
🧠 Intelligence System Activated
Intent: [detected_intent] (confidence: X.XX)  
Executing 1 tools...
[Tool execution with parameters and reasoning]
✅ Tool Executed Successfully
[Actual results from the tool]
```

## 🏆 **What's Been Fixed**

- ✅ **Protocol tools**: Bob shows actual 5 protocols
- ✅ **Memory tools**: Bob executes brain_remember/brain_recall  
- ✅ **Anti-hallucination**: Uses actual tool results instead of making things up
- ✅ **Intelligence routing**: Intent detection → correct tool selection → tool execution

**Try the memory tools first - they should now work perfectly like the protocol tools!** 🎯
