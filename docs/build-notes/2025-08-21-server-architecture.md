# Bob Server Architecture - Resource Sharing Strategy

## Current Brain System Infrastructure

### Already Running Servers
- **Database server** - SQLite/database management (shareable)
- **Ollama** - Local LLM inference (shareable, single instance)
- **MCP servers** - Various brain system tools and protocols
- **Speech processing** - TTS/STT services
- **Protocol management** - Loading and execution systems

### Resource Constraints
- **M1 Mac mini** - Limited memory and CPU resources
- **Multiple concurrent workloads** - Speech, inference, multiple servers
- **Avoid resource contention** - Don't duplicate services unnecessarily

## Bob Server Requirements Analysis

### Servers Bob Can Share
- **Database server** - Add Bob tables/schemas to existing database
- **Ollama instance** - Single LLM server, multiple client connections
- **Existing MCP tools** - Filesystem, git, analysis tools already available
- **Protocol servers** - Extend existing protocol loading/execution infrastructure

### Potential Bob-Specific Needs
- **Bob workflow orchestration** - If different from brain system patterns
- **Bob API endpoints** - Specialized interfaces for Bob operations
- **Bob context assembly** - May need different context loading strategies
- **Bob protocol hierarchies** - Might require specialized protocol organization

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Extend Existing Infrastructure
1. **Add Bob database schema** to existing database server
2. **Create Bob API endpoints** on existing servers where possible
3. **Extend protocol loading** to handle Bob-specific protocol hierarchies
4. **Test resource usage** with combined workload

### Phase 2: Identify Bottlenecks
- **Monitor performance** of shared infrastructure under Bob load
- **Identify resource contention** points between brain system and Bob
- **Profile memory/CPU usage** to find optimization opportunities

### Phase 3: Selective Separation (if needed)
- **Only create separate servers** if performance degrades significantly
- **Priority: keep Ollama and database shared** - these are most resource-intensive
- **Consider lightweight microservices** for Bob-specific coordination logic

## Server Sharing Benefits

### Resource Efficiency
- **Single Ollama instance** - No memory duplication for model weights
- **Shared database** - One connection pool, one storage backend
- **Reduced context switching** - Fewer server processes competing for CPU

### Development Efficiency  
- **Leverage existing code** - Brain system servers already debugged and optimized
- **Unified logging/monitoring** - Single infrastructure to maintain
- **Consistent interfaces** - Same APIs and patterns across systems

### Operational Simplicity
- **Single startup/shutdown** - Manage one set of servers, not two
- **Unified configuration** - One place to manage server settings
- **Easier debugging** - All logs and metrics in same system

## Architecture Decision
**Start with maximum sharing, separate only when necessary.**

Bob should initially be designed as a specialized client of the existing brain system infrastructure, adding new API endpoints and database schemas rather than new server processes. Only create separate servers if performance monitoring reveals unavoidable resource conflicts.

## Next Steps
1. Audit current brain system server APIs to identify extension points
2. Design Bob database schema that coexists with brain system data
3. Plan Bob-specific API endpoints for existing servers
4. Create resource monitoring plan to track shared infrastructure performance
