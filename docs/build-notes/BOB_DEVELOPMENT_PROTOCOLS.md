# Bob Development Protocols v1.0

## Protocol: Development Work Recording

### Purpose
Systematically record every development action to create a complete audit trail of AI building AI.

### Trigger Conditions
- Any code implementation or modification
- Architectural decisions or changes
- Problem-solving sessions
- Integration work
- Testing and validation
- Configuration changes

### Protocol Steps

#### 1. Session Initialization
```markdown
**Session**: YYYY-MM-DD-session-N
**Component**: [target component/system]
**Goal**: [specific objective]
**Context**: [current state/prerequisites]
```

#### 2. Development Action Recording
For each significant action:
```markdown
**Action**: [what was done]
**Reasoning**: [why this approach]
**Implementation**: [how it was done]
**Challenges**: [problems encountered]
**Solutions**: [how problems were resolved]
**Validation**: [how correctness was verified]
```

#### 3. System Map Updates
After each component:
```markdown
**System Impact**: [how this affects overall architecture]
**Dependencies**: [what this component depends on/provides]
**Integration Points**: [how this connects to other components]
**Status**: [current state of component]
```

#### 4. Session Completion
```markdown
**Completed**: [list of completed items]
**In Progress**: [partially completed work]
**Blocked**: [items waiting on dependencies]
**Next Session**: [priorities for next session]
```

### Protocol Outputs
1. **Session Log**: Detailed development record
2. **System Map Update**: Current architecture state
3. **Brain Memory**: Key insights and decisions
4. **Build Notes**: Human-readable documentation

## Protocol: System Map Maintenance

### Purpose
Maintain hierarchical system map for Bob's operational intelligence.

### Update Protocol
1. **Component Addition**: Add new component to appropriate hierarchy level
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Document all dependencies and connections
3. **Status Tracking**: Mark component status (planned/in-progress/complete/testing)
4. **Intelligence Integration**: Update Bob's context with new capabilities

### Intelligence Context Template
Bob's operational awareness includes:
```markdown
# Bob System Intelligence Context

## Current Capabilities
[List of active/functional components]

## Active Protocols
[Currently running protocols]

## System Status
[Overall health and operational state]

## Integration Map
[How components work together]

## Development State
[What's being built/modified]
```

## Protocol: Bob Intelligence Context Management

### Purpose
Manage Bob's self-awareness and operational intelligence.

### Context Window Allocation
- **30% System Map**: Current architecture and capabilities
- **25% Active Protocols**: Running workflows and procedures
- **25% Working Memory**: Current session state and context
- **20% Master Index**: Core system understanding

### Master System Index (for Bob's Smarts)
```markdown
# Bob Master System Index

## Identity
- Name: Bob (Better Organized Brain)
- Version: 5.0
- Purpose: AI-powered project management and assistance
- Architecture: Multi-API, modular, contract-driven

## Core Capabilities
- Multi-tab professional interface (11 tabs)
- Multi-API routing (Ollama/Claude/Gemini/OpenAI)
- Job queue management and processing
- Tool integration and management
- Protocol execution and monitoring
- Knowledge base integration
- Template and workflow systems

## Current State
- Development Phase: [current phase]
- Active Components: [list functional components]
- Integration Status: [connection health]
- Performance Metrics: [key stats]

## Operational Protocols
- Job Processing Protocol
- API Selection Protocol
- Error Recovery Protocol
- User Communication Protocol
- Development Recording Protocol

## Intelligence Architecture
- Context Window: Hierarchical system understanding
- Memory Systems: Brain integration for persistence
- Decision Making: Multi-criteria API selection
- Learning: Pattern recognition from usage
```

### Context Updates
Bob's intelligence context gets updated when:
- New components are implemented
- System architecture changes
- New protocols are activated
- Integration status changes
- Performance characteristics shift

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Protocol Infrastructure
1. **Create protocol execution system** in Bob
2. **Implement development recording protocol**
3. **Build system map maintenance system**
4. **Design intelligence context management**

### Phase 2: Bob's Self-Awareness
1. **Implement master system index**
2. **Create hierarchical system understanding**
3. **Build context window management**
4. **Add protocol registry integration**

### Phase 3: Development Integration
1. **Connect development protocols to Bob's intelligence**
2. **Real-time system map updates**
3. **Automated development logging**
4. **Intelligence context evolution tracking**

This creates a recursive development system where:
- **Bob gains self-awareness** of his own architecture
- **Development work is automatically recorded** via protocols
- **System understanding evolves** as Bob is built
- **Intelligence context stays current** with development state

Bob becomes **aware of himself** as he's being built! ðŸ§ âœ¨
