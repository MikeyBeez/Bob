# Knowledge Graph System via Edges

## Overview

The knowledge graph system implemented in Ollama_Agents uses an edge-based approach to represent and store relationships between different pieces of information. This system allows for flexible and efficient storage of complex relationships, enabling powerful querying and inference capabilities.

## Schema

The core of our knowledge graph is the `edges` table in the SQLite database. The schema for this table is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS edges (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    source_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    target_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    relationship_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    strength REAL NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(source_id, target_id, relationship_type)
);
```

Key components:
- `source_id` and `target_id`: Represent the nodes connected by this edge.
- `relationship_type`: Describes the nature of the connection.
- `strength`: A numerical value indicating the strength or confidence of the relationship.
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for tracking the edge's history.

## Simple Functions

In the initial stages, we plan to implement basic functions to interact with the knowledge graph:

1. `add_edge(source_id, target_id, relationship_type, strength)`:
   Adds a new edge to the graph or updates an existing one.

2. `get_related_nodes(node_id, relationship_type=None)`:
   Retrieves all nodes connected to a given node, optionally filtered by relationship type.

3. `search_by_relationship(relationship_type)`:
   Finds all edges of a specific relationship type.

4. `update_edge_strength(source_id, target_id, relationship_type, new_strength)`:
   Modifies the strength of an existing edge.

5. `delete_edge(source_id, target_id, relationship_type)`:
   Removes an edge from the graph.

## Complex Functions and Future Use

As the system evolves, we envision implementing more sophisticated functions:

1. Path Finding:
   `find_path(start_node, end_node, max_depth)`: Discovers connections between two nodes, potentially revealing indirect relationships.

2. Similarity Clustering:
   `find_similar_nodes(node_id, threshold)`: Identifies nodes with similar connection patterns, useful for recommendation systems or data categorization.

3. Knowledge Inference:
   `infer_new_relationships()`: Analyzes existing edges to suggest potential new relationships based on patterns in the data.

4. Importance Ranking:
   `rank_nodes_by_centrality()`: Determines the most central or important nodes in the graph based on their connections.

5. Dynamic Relationship Strength:
   `update_strengths_over_time()`: Adjusts relationship strengths based on factors like frequency of access or age of the connection.

6. Contextual Subgraphs:
   `extract_context(node_id, depth)`: Extracts a subgraph around a given node to provide context for queries or analysis.

7. Multi-hop Querying:
   `multi_hop_query(start_node, relationship_sequence)`: Allows for complex queries that follow a specific sequence of relationship types.

## Integration with Ollama_Agents

The knowledge graph will serve as a powerful backend for the Ollama_Agents system:

1. Memory Enhancement:
   Agents can store and retrieve information more effectively, maintaining context across multiple interactions.

2. Reasoning Support:
   By traversing the graph, agents can make more informed decisions and provide more comprehensive responses.

3. Learning and Adaptation:
   As new information is added to the graph, agents can dynamically update their knowledge and behaviors.

4. Cross-Domain Insights:
   The graph structure allows for discovering non-obvious connections between different domains or topics.

5. Personalization:
   By associating user-specific nodes with general knowledge, the system can provide tailored responses and recommendations.

## Conclusion

The edge-based knowledge graph system provides a flexible and powerful foundation for representing complex information in Ollama_Agents. As we implement and expand upon these functions, the system will enable increasingly sophisticated AI behaviors, from basic fact retrieval to complex reasoning and personalized interactions.
