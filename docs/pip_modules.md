Ollama_Agents project:

# Ollama_Agents: Key Dependencies and Their Usage

## 1. duckduckgo_search
- **Purpose**: Provides an interface to perform DuckDuckGo searches
- **Usage**: Used in the `ddg_search.py` module to implement web search capabilities for the AI assistant, allowing it to fetch current information from the internet.

## 2. fabric
- **Purpose**: High-level SSH command execution on remote machines
- **Usage**: Utilized in `fabric_commands.py` for running Fabric patterns, enhancing AI interactions with predefined templates. This allows for more structured and customizable AI responses.

## 3. langchain and langchain-community
- **Purpose**: Framework for developing applications powered by language models
- **Usage**: Used specifically for the DuckDuckGo search functionality in `ddg_search.py`. The `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` tool from langchain_community is employed to perform web searches, integrating internet search capabilities into the AI assistant.

## 4. numpy
- **Purpose**: Numerical computing library
- **Usage**: Used in `memory_search.py` for vector operations, particularly in calculating similarity scores between embeddings using functions like `np.dot` and `norm`. This is crucial for implementing memory search functionality in the AI assistant.

## 5. ollama
- **Purpose**: Client library for interacting with Ollama models
- **Usage**: Central to the project, used in `ollama_client.py` for sending prompts to and receiving responses from Ollama models. Also used in `memory_search.py` for generating embeddings, forming the core of the AI interaction capabilities.

## 6. prompt_toolkit
- **Purpose**: Library for building powerful interactive command-line applications
- **Usage**: Employed in `input.py` to create an enhanced, interactive command-line interface with features like autocomplete, command history, and custom key bindings, significantly improving the user experience.

## 7. requests
- **Purpose**: HTTP library for making API requests
- **Usage**: Used in `ollama_client.py` for making HTTP requests to the Ollama API, specifically for sending prompts and receiving streaming responses, enabling real-time interaction with the AI model.

## 8. rich
- **Purpose**: Library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal
- **Usage**: Extensively used throughout the project (e.g., in `banner.py`, `ollama_client.py`, `basic_commands.py`) to create colorful and visually appealing command-line output, including formatted text, panels, and live updates, enhancing the overall user interface.

These libraries form the core functionality of the Ollama_Agents project, enabling features like AI model interaction, web searching, an advanced command-line interface, and visually appealing output. They work together to create a sophisticated, interactive AI assistant with various capabilities, providing a rich and user-friendly experience.
