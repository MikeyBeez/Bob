# ‚ùì Bob FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Q: What is Bob exactly?**
**A:** Bob is an **LLM-as-Kernel Intelligence System** - think of it as an AI operating system rather than just a chatbot. Bob combines natural conversation with 72 specialized tools and 54+ protocols, all orchestrated through advanced job queue management. You chat naturally, and Bob intelligently uses whatever capabilities are needed behind the scenes.

### **Q: How is Bob different from ChatGPT or Claude?**
**A:** While ChatGPT and Claude are conversational AI, Bob is a complete **AI Operating System**:
- **72 specialized tools** across 7 categories (filesystem, git, analysis, development, etc.)
- **Advanced job orchestration** with priority queues and workflow management
- **Intelligent tool selection** - Bob chooses the right capabilities automatically
- **Enterprise features** like real-time monitoring and performance analytics
- **Extensible framework** for building advanced AI systems

### **Q: Do I need programming experience to use Bob?**
**A:** **No!** Bob is designed for natural conversation. Just chat normally:
```
üí¨ "Hello Bob, can you help me analyze my project?"
ü§ñ "I'd be happy to help! Which project would you like me to examine?"
```
Bob handles all the technical complexity behind the scenes.

### **Q: What can Bob actually do for me?**
**A:** Bob can help with:
- **Development**: Project analysis, code review, git management
- **System Administration**: Health monitoring, file management, performance tracking
- **Research & Analysis**: Web searches, text analysis, pattern recognition
- **Productivity**: Task management, memory storage, workflow automation
- **Learning**: Explanations, tutorials, cognitive processing

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### **Q: What are the system requirements?**
**A:** 
- **OS**: macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 18.04+, or Windows 10+
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- **Software**: Python 3.8+, Node.js 14+, Git
- **Storage**: 2GB free space
- **Network**: Internet for initial setup

### **Q: How do I install Bob?**
**A:** Quick installation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MikeyBeez/Bob.git
cd Bob
./setup.sh
./chat
```
See [Installation Guide](./installation.md) for detailed instructions.

### **Q: Bob won't start - what do I do?**
**A:** Check these common issues:
1. **Are you in the Bob directory?** `pwd` should show `/path/to/Bob`
2. **Are scripts executable?** Run `chmod +x ./bob ./chat ./repl`
3. **Dependencies installed?** Check `python --version` and `node --version`
4. **Try the Python interface:** `python bob_cli.py` as a fallback

### **Q: I'm getting dependency errors during installation**
**A:** Try these solutions:
```bash
# Clear caches
npm cache clean --force
pip cache purge

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install

# Check Python/Node versions
python --version  # Should be 3.8+
node --version    # Should be 14+
```

## üí¨ Using Bob

### **Q: How do I chat with Bob naturally?**
**A:** Just start a conversation! Bob responds to natural language:
```
üí¨ "Hi Bob, how are you?"
üí¨ "What can you help me with?"
üí¨ "Can you analyze this code file?"
üí¨ "Remember that I prefer TypeScript"
üí¨ "What's my system status?"
```
No special commands needed - Bob understands context.

### **Q: When does Bob use tools vs. just conversation?**
**A:** Bob automatically detects when tools would be helpful:
- **Pure conversation**: Greetings, questions, explanations
- **Tool usage**: Analysis requests, system queries, file operations, memory storage
- **Keywords that trigger tools**: "analyze", "status", "remember", "find", "check"

### **Q: Can I see what tools Bob is using?**
**A:** Yes! Bob often mentions tool usage:
```
ü§ñ "Based on my analysis: [tool results integrated naturally]"
ü§ñ "I found your project using my brain system tools..."
```
For more visibility, try the brain REPL: `./repl` ‚Üí option 2

### **Q: How do I exit Bob?**
**A:** Several options:
- Type `exit` or `quit`
- Press `Ctrl+C`
- Type `help` to see all commands

### **Q: Bob gives weird or incorrect responses**
**A:** Try these approaches:
1. **Be more specific**: "Analyze this Python file for performance" vs. "check this"
2. **Ask for clarification**: "Can you explain what you just did?"
3. **Use system commands**: `status` to check Bob's health
4. **Restart if needed**: Exit and restart Bob

## üß† Brain System & Tools

### **Q: What are the 72 tools Bob has?**
**A:** Bob's tools are organized in 7 categories:
- **Core (22)**: Filesystem, git, memory, system operations
- **Intelligence (9)**: Cognitive processing, pattern analysis
- **Memory (6)**: Storage, recall, context management
- **Development (11)**: Project management, code analysis
- **Analysis (6)**: Web search, reasoning, bullshit detection
- **Utility (10)**: System info, networking, random generation
- **Workflow (8)**: Task management, reminders, protocols

Type `brain tools` in chat to explore categories.

### **Q: What are the 54+ protocols?**
**A:** Protocols are enhanced workflows for complex operations:
- **Foundation**: Error recovery, system health, initialization
- **Intelligence**: Cognitive processing, analysis workflows
- **Workflow**: Task orchestration, project management
- **Integration**: Tool chaining, complex multi-step operations

### **Q: Can I create custom tools or protocols?**
**A:** Yes! Bob has an extensible architecture:
- **Custom tools**: Add to the brain system registry
- **Custom protocols**: Use the protocol creation framework
- **API integration**: Connect Bob to external systems
See [API Documentation](../api/README.md) for details.

### **Q: How does the job queue system work?**
**A:** Bob uses hierarchical async processing:
- **Critical Queue**: System health, user-facing operations (3 max concurrent)
- **High Queue**: Analysis requests, important tasks (2 max concurrent)  
- **Normal Queue**: Background processing (2 max concurrent)
- **Low Queue**: Maintenance, cleanup (1 max concurrent)

Jobs can have dependencies and complex workflows.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Q: Bob is running slowly**
**A:** Performance optimization tips:
1. **Check system resources**: `status` command shows performance
2. **Reduce concurrent jobs**: Modify config in `config/bob_config.json`
3. **Clear caches**: Restart Bob to refresh memory
4. **Check background jobs**: Some analysis takes time

### **Q: Tools aren't working properly**
**A:** Debug steps:
1. **Test brain system**: `node test_brain_integration.js`
2. **Check tool registry**: `brain tools` to see available tools
3. **Verify dependencies**: Ensure all packages installed correctly
4. **Check logs**: Look in `logs/` folder for error messages

### **Q: I can't remember Bob's commands**
**A:** Use the built-in help:
