# 🎯 Bob REPL Interfaces - Complete Interactive Access

## 🚀 Bob now provides TWO powerful REPL interfaces:

### 🧠 Bob Brain REPL (Node.js) - **NEW!**
**Interactive access to complete brain system with 72 tools and 54+ protocols**

```bash
cd ~/Bob
./repl
# or
node bob_brain_repl.js
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Direct access to all 72 brain system tools
- ✅ Interactive protocol execution (54+ enhanced protocols)
- ✅ Real-time system monitoring and health checks
- ✅ Tool categorization and discovery
- ✅ Batch operations and performance metrics
- ✅ Command history, completion, and built-in help
- ✅ JSON parameter support for complex operations
- ✅ Auto-initialization and graceful shutdown

**Key Commands:**
- `help` - Show all commands with examples
- `tools [category]` - List tools by category (core, intelligence, memory, etc.)
- `exec <tool> [params]` - Execute any tool interactively
- `run <protocol> [context]` - Run enhanced protocols
- `status` - System status and metrics
- `health` - Component health checks

### 🐍 Bob CLI (Python) - **Original**
**Traditional CLI interface for core Bob functionality**

```bash
cd ~/Bob
python bob_cli.py
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Interactive REPL-style interface
- ✅ Core intelligence operations (think, query, reflect, learn)
- ✅ Knowledge management (store, retrieve, knowledge-graph)
- ✅ System management (status, metrics, health, init, cleanup)
- ✅ Command history and rich formatting
- ✅ Asynchronous operation with proper error handling

## 🎪 Quick Start Examples

### Brain REPL Session:
```bash
cd ~/Bob && ./repl

🧠 Bob> help
🧠 Bob> tools intelligence
🧠 Bob> exec cognition:cognition_process {"content": "How does reasoning work?"}
🧠 Bob> run error-recovery {"testMode": true}
🧠 Bob> status
🧠 Bob> metrics
🧠 Bob> exit
```

### Python CLI Session:
```bash
cd ~/Bob && python bob_cli.py

bob> help
bob> think "What are the implications of quantum computing?"
bob> store '{"topic": "AI", "content": "Advanced reasoning systems"}'
bob> retrieve "reasoning"
bob> status
bob> exit
```
