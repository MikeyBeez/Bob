# UI/UX Feedback and Suggestions

This file contains suggestions and feedback regarding the user interface and overall user experience of the agent platform, as provided by the user.

## Agent Status Indicator

**Date:** 2025-09-19
**User Feedback:** The agent's status indicator in the UI should be more descriptive.
**Suggestion:** When the agent is idle and waiting for a command, the status should display 'Ready' or 'Idle' instead of a generic 'Working' animation.

**Reasoning:** A 'Working' status is misleading when the agent is not actively processing a task. An accurate status indicator improves clarity and helps the user understand the agent's current state, leading to a better collaborative experience.

## UI Layout and Information Persistence

**Date:** 2025-09-19
**User Feedback:** The UI layout has some confusing and cluttered elements.
**Suggestions:**
1.  **Persistent Plan Display:** A plan from a completed task should not remain visible in the UI.
2.  **Collapsible Plan:** The plan display should be collapsible so the user can hide it when not needed.
3.  **Collapsible Code Section:** The section displaying code (e.g., file contents, diffs) should be collapsible, as some users prefer to focus on the high-level interaction and not the code itself.
4.  **History Panel:** Past interactions could be moved to a dedicated, collapsible 'History' panel on the left side of the screen.
5.  **Message Ordering:** The conversation flow should be chronological from top to bottom, with the newest messages appearing at the bottom.

**Reasoning:** A clean, intuitive, and chronological UI with collapsible elements would significantly reduce clutter and make it easier for the user to follow the agent's actions and the overall progress of the collaboration.
