# Command Handling Refactoring Plan

## Current Structure

Currently, command handling is split between `main.py` and `slash_commands.py`:

1. In `main.py`:
   - `/upload`: Handled directly in the main loop
   - `/ms`: Handled directly in the main loop
   - `/ch`: Handled directly in the main loop
   - `/hi`: Handled directly in the main loop

2. In `slash_commands.py`:
   - `/h`, `/help`: Call `get_help()`
   - `/e`, `/exit`, `/q`, `/quit`: Call `exit_program()`
   - `/tr`: Call `truncate_history()`
   - `/msl`: Call `memory_search_long()`
   - `/cm`: Call `change_model_command()`
   - `/s`: Call `duck_duck_go_search()`
   - `/fabric`: Call `fabric_command()`

## Proposed Structure

All command handling will be unified in `slash_commands.py`:

1. Move all command handling from `main.py` to `slash_commands.py`
2. Update `SLASH_COMMANDS` dictionary in `slash_commands.py` to include all commands
3. Modify `main.py` to use a single path for all command handling

## Implementation Plan

1. Update `slash_commands.py`:
   - Add new command handlers for `/upload`, `/ms`, `/ch`, and `/hi`
   - Update `SLASH_COMMANDS` dictionary with new entries
   - Modify `handle_slash_command()` to accommodate new commands

2. Modify `main.py`:
   - Remove direct handling of `/upload`, `/ms`, `/ch`, and `/hi`
   - Ensure all user input is processed through `get_user_input()`

3. Update `input.py`:
   - Verify that `get_user_input()` correctly routes all slash commands

4. Update related modules:
   - Modify `document_commands.py`, `memory_commands.py` as needed to support new structure

5. Update unit tests:
   - Adjust existing tests to reflect new command handling structure
   - Add new tests for relocated command handlers

6. Manual testing:
   - Verify all commands work as expected in the new structure

## Potential Risks and Considerations

1. Backward Compatibility: Ensure existing scripts or integrations aren't broken
2. Performance: Verify that the new structure doesn't introduce unnecessary overhead
3. User Experience: Confirm that command behavior remains consistent from the user's perspective
4. Error Handling: Ensure proper error messages are maintained in the new structure

## Timeline

- Day 1-2: Implementation of changes in `slash_commands.py` and `main.py`
- Day 3-4: Updates to related modules and initial unit test adjustments
- Day 5-6: Comprehensive testing (unit tests and manual testing)
- Day 7: Code review and refinements
- Day 8-9: Final testing and documentation updates
- Day 10: Prepare for merge into main branch

## Success Criteria

1. All commands function correctly in the new structure
2. No regression in existing functionality
3. Improved code organization and maintainability
4. All tests passing
5. Updated documentation reflecting the new structure

## Review Process

1. Code review by at least two team members
2. Functionality testing by QA team
3. Final review of changes and updated documentation by project lead

## Rollback Plan

In case of unforeseen issues:
1. Revert to the last known good commit on the main branch
2. Address identified issues in the feature branch
3. Re-implement changes with necessary adjustments
