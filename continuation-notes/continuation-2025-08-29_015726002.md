## 📚 Context Bridge for Next Session

### Enhanced System State
🔧 MAJOR PROGRESS: Bob LLM-as-Kernel Intelligence System brain integration actively underway! Created comprehensive async bridge system that wraps all 30+ MCP tools for Bob integration, protocol migration engine that brings 25+ brain system protocols to Bob with async support, and started async job queue system for background processing. All brain system capabilities being systematically migrated: Core tools (brain, filesystem, database, git), Intelligence tools (cognition, contemplation, subconscious), Memory tools (memory-ema, mercury-evolution), Development tools (architecture, protocol-engine), Analysis tools (bullshit-detector, github-research), Utility tools (random, system, vision), Workflow tools (continuation-notes, todo-manager). Bob gaining full brain system capabilities with async execution, chat optimization, and background job processing. Foundation complete, need to finish implementation and testing.
